# React + TypeScript + Vite

Explanation:

No mention of next js or need for ssr, so i opted for vite with only client side.
Stack:
Tailwind, Shadcn for styling/components
React query for state managment
React Router for the basic routing

RoadMap:
Make apis work, and get data working.
Work on the basic layout for the app.
Work on routing and search component.
Add react router.
Take a look at virtualization based, if needed.
